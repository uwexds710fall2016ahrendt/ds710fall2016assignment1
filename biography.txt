1. What is your name?

Shawn Peters

2. Why are you interested in Data Science?

I see it as a major opportunity for future growth in the tech industry and want to be involved in that.  Additionally, we do not have a data scientist or any formal data collection/analysis initiative at JAMF Software and as such we are unable to make the most informed decisions possible.  

3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.  What programming courses have you taken?  Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?

I am the Automation and Tools team lead in the Quality Assurance department at JAMF.  I took Intro to Object Oriented Programming last fall at UWEC, otherwise I do not have formal training.  I have acquired basic programming experience outside of the classroom including developing a test case management software, a couple of apps on the iOS App Store, automated scripting of workflows using Ruby and Bash, and freelance website development.  

4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience.  What statistics courses have you taken?  Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?

I took Econometrics in college, otherwise I do not have any other experience with statistics.

5.  Do you have other experience with R or Python?

The first time I used R was in DS 700 which I took over the summer, and I have not written any Python but I have read and executed some scripts at work.

6.  What do you hope to learn in this class?

Smart use of Python and R to perform the tasks necessary to complete the class but also have a solid foundation to build off of in the future.  

7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?

I graduated in from UWEC with a BS in Mathematics in 2011.  I'm excited to have UWEC staff teaching this course.
