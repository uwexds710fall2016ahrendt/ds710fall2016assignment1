Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.
1. What is your name? 
My name is Maggie Schweihs.
2. Why are you interested in Data Science?
I am interested in Data Science for many reasons. On a personal level, I have always enjoyed math, computers and journalism and Data Science is a natural fit for all three. Professionally, I am interested in finding patterns in data that help humans understand the big picture. I am currently installing an ELK stack to analyze the system logs of the servers I manage. My intention is to clean the logs and visualize them with Kibana (K in ELK) to better manage our systems. I work as a systems administrator and am interested in the application of Data Science to computer systems and cyber security, among many other things. 
3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.  What programming courses have you taken?  Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?
I have taken three intro level programming classes: C++, Java and Web Development (HTML, CSS). At work, I write scripts, not programs, using BASH, Korn Shell, powershelgl, Perl (rarely). I have occasionally had the misfortune to translate COBOL (very rarely).
4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience.  What statistics courses have you taken?  Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?
I have taken a decent amount of statistics: Elementary Statistics (not calc based), College Statistics (Calc II based), and Advanced Statistics (Calc based, Mini-Tab used).
5.  Do you have other experience with R or Python?
I have been reading and experimenting with R and Python but I have no real experience. We used R a bit in DS700, which I took Spring2016.
6.  What do you hope to learn in this class?
I hope to learn how and when to use R and Python. I am excited to be using GitHub, Jupiter Notebooks, and the Anaconda distribution. I hope to learn about how to integrate all of these software environments and how to keep them up to date and organized. I also hope to learn some best practices related to using notebooks and github.
7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?
I am really excited for this class! I am hoping to attend some Big Data Madison (or other Data Science) Meetups this semester and would enjoy meeting some classmates!
