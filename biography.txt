7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?
I live in Junction City, Wisconsin.  I have been happily married for 5 years to my wonderful wife Fawn.  We have 3 beautiful children; Kylie(4), Emmett(3) and Liberty(1).  Most of our time is taken up with them, but it is totally worth it.  I graduated from UWEC in August 2008 achieving my BBA in Information System with an emphasis in development.  I started working at Travel Guard in Stevens Point, WI prior that summer and started there as a BI Developer working mainly in SQL Server and SQL Server Reporting Services.  Then I transitioned into an application development role and completed a lot of C# development until I left in 2012.  Since then I have been doing a lot of R&D and data development for the current company I am with.  This grew me into my current role as a Data Architect at Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection.  Currently, I am working with the Azure technologies and I have been focused on the Business Intelligence side of things.  Overall, I joined the Data Science program to enhance my statistical knowledge base and to get a formal education in these analysis area.  I am hoping that achieving this education will help me advance my career and also allow me help assist others in the process.  Someday I would love to manage my own team of Data Scientists/Analysts/Developers by either running my owne company or by being a CIO at another.  I know that the knowledge I gain from this course will be instrumental for that task.  Otherwise, I am married and have 3 amazing children which I love to spend most of my free time with.  For my hobbies I enjoy motorcyle riding, home brewing, water skiing, swimming, bike riding, long walks, running, resistance training, and an occational rental movie.
