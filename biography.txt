Nicholas Logan
I am interested in data science to continue advancing the use of data analytics in assessing risk for Internal Audit.
I have limited programing experience.  I am self-taught in R.  I have taken a intro to programing class which taught java.  I do some programing for my job using ACL (an audit specific data analytic tool).
I have limited statistics experience.  I took introductory course in statistics during my undergrad.  I recently took a course on Coursera on inferential statistics.
I have no experience with python other than taking some basic online tutorials.  I have been learning R for the last year and will begin using it in my work soon.
I am hoping to get a good baseline knowledge of python and R that I can continue to build on.
I am really excited about this course and look to learn a lot from it.
