I am interested in data science because I want to further my career as a data analyst and be able to give deeper insights to my company.
I have been learning programming for 6 months now so I'm still relatively new. I've taken courses for R and Python on Coursera and Udemy. I don't code for my job 
but I'm looking forward to bringing it to the work place and bettering some of our processes.
I have taken the required statistics homework for college, which are elementary and intermediate stats. I do basic statistics for my job but I'd like to take things to another level.
I've taken intro courses to both languages.
I hope to learn how to apply new coding techniques to my job and just become a more efficient coder all around.
There's nothing in particular that I want to share but I am an open book so feel free to ask me questions if you'd like to know something.
