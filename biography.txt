I have always been interested in information and building models to solve and illustrate problems. In particular, I am interested in statistical learning, applications in “bots” and game theory.

I have recently left a position of 16 years of product management, design and development. I have experience with php, java, javascript, sql, vb.

No statistics experience except the Statistical Methods course. I am working through probability texts and linear algebra.

None except in the coursework here and a few tutorials from gaggle.

Python and better understanding of git (we used tortoise svn at my last job and git seems like the reverse of repository methodology).

None
