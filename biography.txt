Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.

1. What is your name? 

My name is Nicholas Martel-Arquette

2. Why are you interested in Data Science?

In the past several months, I've read about the subject of data science in various articles.  When I looked at the course materials in the University of Wisconsin Data Science program, all of the subjects were very interesting and were all topics that I wanted to learn more about.

3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.  

What programming courses have you taken?  

I have taken programming classes (C#, PowerShell, t-SQL, MySQL, Ruby On Rails, .Net MVC, and Python) online on various websites (codecademy, plural sight, udemy) and by reading literature.

Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?

I use t-sql on a daily basis in addition to Sql Server Integration Services.
If I'm installing objects on different machines, I often rely on PowerShell to help run the objects in any environment that I need.

4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience.  

What statistics courses have you taken?  

I've taken statistics as a part of my undergraduate training in Economics in 2002.  
It was recommended that I review material to get familiar with the subject again.  
As a result, I'm taking an online class on statistics in Khan Academy.

Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?

Not at all.

5.  Do you have other experience with R or Python?

I took a Python tutorial on codecademy prior to enrolling to the program in May 2016.  The only exposure I've had with R was in a previous class (Data Science 700 Foundations).

6.  What do you hope to learn in this class?

I hope to learn more about python and determine how I can use it for Data Science and how it can be included into my current profession.

7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?

I'm a parent of two small children (age 5(boy) and age 4(girl)) and work fulltime in the Healthcare Industry Technology sector (not Epic).  
I've been in the industry (Healthcare Information Technology) for over 10 years and want to take Data Science into the Healthcare Realm as I believe it is the next frontier for this market.
Presently, I'm the product manager of a Reporting and Data warehouse solution for an Electronic Health Record.
