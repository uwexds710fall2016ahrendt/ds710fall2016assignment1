I have recently started my own operations consulting business and I see many opportunities to utilize data to improve manufacturing efforts
Fairly limited  programming experience, I do not yet program as part of my consuting efforts, however I have taken R and Python online courses
I use statistics often on the job, I have a degree in Chemistry and a specialization in applied mathematics.
Generally limited experience to online courses, Coursera and Codecademy
I hope to begin to build a strong programming foundation in R and Python
Great experience so far with UofW Data Science and I am looking forward to the course ... Thanks
