Data science hits all of my strengths and interests either directly (computer science, statistics, database analytics) or is a great complement to them (economics, business analytics, finance). Additionally, data science is extremely topical and important in the future of my industry - Healthcare IT. Data science holds long term opporutnities but also immediate benefits to my current career as a pricing analyst. 

I took several introductory computer programming courses in college and high school but that was a decade ago. In my job I use basic programming skills, primarly SQL and VBA, on a regular basis. 

I've always enjoyed statistics and took several statistics classes in college with an economic and business focus, such as econometrics and statistics for business. I use basic (though not advanced) statistical techniques in my job as a pricing analysis. 

My only experience is using R in the intro to data science course as part of this program. I have no experience in Python and even something like Git is new to me. 

Beyond learning the languages needed for data science I really hope to just strengthen my programming skills generally. 

I am excited and optimistic for this class but as someone with a less technical background I think this is the real test to see if this program is for me.
