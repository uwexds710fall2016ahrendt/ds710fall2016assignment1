R Programming Assignment
Homework 1:  Share text file containing R code
For each of the following, copy your R code and the output (and your written response, for part 1.8) into a .r, .txt, .doc, .docx, or .rmd document.  Submit your finished document to GitHub.

1.0  Open R.  The first line of text in the console window tells you which version of R you are running (this should be version 3.1.2).  Copy this line of text into a document, to verify that you’ve installed the correct version.

R version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31) -- "Pumpkin Helmet"

1.1 Calculate the cube root of 2015, as follows: 
2015^(1/3)

Code and Output:
> 2015^(1/3)
[1] 12.63063

1.2 Find the absolute value of 5.7 minus 6.8 divided by .58: 
abs(5.7-6.8)/.58

Code and Output:
> abs(5.7-6.8)/.58
[1] 1.896552

1.3 Create a list of integers from 1 to 12 and call it “a”:
a = 1:12
a   #(this will print a, so you can paste it into your homework; do this each time)

Code and Output:
> a = 1:12; a
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

1.4 Create a sequence of odd numbers from 1 to 11:
b = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)
b

Code and Output:
> b = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11); b
[1]  1  3  5  7  9 11

1.5 Create the same sequence in another way:
c = seq(1,11, 2)
c

Code and Output:
> c = seq(1,11,2); c
[1]  1  3  5  7  9 11

1.6 Take the natural log (ln) of a. (Note that this is done to the entire “vector” called a.)
ln.a = log(a)
ln.a

Code and Output:
> ln.a = log(a); ln.a
 [1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944 1.6094379 1.7917595 1.9459101 2.0794415 2.1972246
[10] 2.3025851 2.3978953 2.4849066

1.7 Compute the squares of the odd numbers from 1 to 11.

Code and Output:
> c.sq = seq(1,11,2)^2; c.sq
[1]   1   9  25  49  81 121

1.8 Use ?sd to view the help file for the sd function.  What does it do?

Code and Output:
> ?sd

Standard Deviation

Description

This function computes the standard deviation of the values in x. If na.rm is TRUE then missing values are removed before computation proceeds.

Usage

sd(x, na.rm = FALSE)
Arguments

x	
a numeric vector or an R object which is coercible to one by as.vector(x, "numeric").

na.rm	
logical. Should missing values be removed?

Details

Like var this uses denominator n - 1.

The standard deviation of a zero-length vector (after removal of NAs if na.rm = TRUE) is not defined and gives an error. The standard deviation of a length-one vector is NA.

See Also

var for its square, and mad, the most robust alternative.

Examples

sd(1:2) ^ 2


This displays the help page for the Standard Deviation function.  The output includes a brief overview of the function's purpose, the usage of the function including a description of any arguments,
other related details and functions as well as an example of the function's usage.


1.9. Create a variable Name that contains your first name.  Because your name is a character string, not a number, you will need to put it in quotes so that R knows not to go looking for a variable with that name:
Name = "Susan"
Then type
paste("My name is", Name)

Code and Output:
> Name = "Jennifer"
> paste("My name is", Name)
[1] "My name is Jennifer"

1.10  When you shut down R, R will ask if you want to save the workspace image.  Always choose no. 
(Saving the workspace image means saving in memory any variables you have defined.  It does not save the code you wrote—you need to save your code in a .r file, or script, for this.  Saving your variables can be confusing:  If you later write another function that’s supposed to use, say, the name of a company, stored in the variable Name, but forget to initialize it, normally R would give you an error message that you could use to figure out your mistake.  But if you save the workspace image, then R won’t give an error message.  It will just use the stored value of Name—but that’s your name, not the company name.  This produces a bug that can be much harder to track down.)
